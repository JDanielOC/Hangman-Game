<!-- DESIGN
	================================

	Body of html will include L&O logo at top with a background image of the season one cast. game will hopefully include sounds to go along with winning or losing the game and perhaps a sound when a correct letter is guessed.
-->

<!-- JAVASCRIPT 
	================================

	Game will be designed with a list of variables. Repetition is a concern. I have 20 words in an array. I'd like it to pull a random word from the array to use for the game and not repeat. 

	Also would like a prompt if a key other than a letter is chosen. "that is not a letter"
